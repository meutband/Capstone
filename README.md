The coffee industry's future wull remain unsecured until transparency, shared value, and the opportunity for presperity amoung smallholder farmers become an industry norm. 

Equipping farners to build a financial foundation based on their coffee businesses creates space for them to reclaim power over their future and in doing so they will ensure our future coffee supply.
